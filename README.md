# RepoExplorer

RepoExplorer is the best AI-powered code finder that scours the web to discover high-quality, running source code based on user prompts. Designed to help developers quickly find reliable and up-to-date code, RepoExplorer ensures a smooth and seamless search experience with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.

## Features
- **AI Code Finder:** Use AI to discover the best, well-maintained source code available on the web according to your specific search criteria.
- **Advanced Search:** Enter natural language prompts to locate projects based on programming languages, licenses, stars, and more.
- **Filter Options:** Refine your search by choosing a programming language, number of stars, or recent updates to get the most relevant code.
- **Pagination:** Easily browse through large sets of results.
- **Skeleton Loading:** Get visual feedback during search operations for a smooth user experience.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Navigate through an intuitive interface with clear sidebars for easy access to the search and filter functions.

## Example Prompts
Here are some example prompts you can use with RepoExplorer to find exactly what you need:

- **Find blockchain projects with the MIT license.**
- **Show React projects with over 100 stars.**
- **List Python repositories for machine learning, sorted by stars.**
- **Give me some blockchain projects with MIT license.**
- **Find top blockchain projects with the MIT license.**

## How It Works
1. **Search**: Enter a natural language query in the search bar to begin.
2. **Filters**: Apply filters such as programming language, license type, or popularity (stars) to narrow down the results.
